My entry for the JAM, its basically a 1 vs 1 soccer game played with 2 monster trucks where you have 10 seconds (theme) to score a goal, to make the gameplay more "interesting" you have a blocker in the form of another truck trying to obstruct you and also while contending with a damp pitch and ball bounce.

The game was built using unity 3d v4.2 as I felt most comfortable with it for producing a fast prototype in the time frame alloted.  Althought I was targeting the 48 hour contest, I based my camera shake on a slightly modified version of the
XNA code samples http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/camera_shake and in keeping with the rules, this is the reason this submission was for the JAM and not the 48hour contest.
